                  <h2><b>What is this Website all about?</b></h2><br>
                  
                  This website is dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of <b>Number System Conversion</b> and its 
                  <b>Base Calculator</b>. It was thoughtfully crafted by <b>Vince Edward Blaya</b>, a passionate front-end 
                  developer known for his talent in creating simple yet visually appealing web designs. As a 1st Year College 
                  student at the <b>University of Cebu Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue (UCLM)</b>, Vince embarked on this project as 
                  part of a school requirement under the guidance of their Web Development Professor. The goal was to design 
                  a functional and engaging website focused on the intricacies of Number System Conversion, complete with a 
                  fully operational Converter or Base Calculator. Vince poured his creativity and skills into this project, 
                  completing it on December 7, 2024, and successfully presenting it on December 9. This website stands as a 
                  testament to his dedication and growing expertise in web development.
